    m_Localized: "Brazil, March 2120\n\nSociety turned into total chaos after the
      appearance of a new deadly virus, Skolvirus. At first glance, the virus represented
      just one more \u201Clittle flu\u201D, however, the population did not respect
      the security measures stipulated by the government and the disease spread more
      and more."

      to change, and the symptoms became more severe, people who were just having
      difficulty breathing, suffered genetic changes and had outbreaks of aggression.
      Public health can no longer deal with the virus and the Brazilian press places
      the blame on a game called \u201CPlague Inc.\u201D, implying that it would
      have taught the virus how mutations are possible."

      Those infected already account for more than
      80% of the population. As a result of the genetic modification, they were thirsty
      for human blood. The meaning we knew by the term society, no longer exists,
      zombies dominate the streets, their blood and saliva are the main means of
      contagion.  Zombies are extremely resistant and are only able to die with a
      direct shot to the head, the luck is that we found that they are stupid, and
      so they do not directly attack people, but rather, they are making random movements,
      however when contacting someone, death is certain ... or half death ...'

      All continents are infected.
      Only a few people walk the streets or are still alive (the suicide rate has
      increased considerably). Few people try to fight the infected, and they are
      codenamed Kamikazes (A cooler term, but usually they just call them suicidal).
      Several powers try to seek a cure, but so far nothing.'

      You are Douglas, a former student, unemployed
      accountant and asthmatic, never had military training or knew how to use weapons,
      but your passion for shooting games shed light on how to survive this apocalypse,
      in addition to the tips of a serious who watched when more new, The MoonWalker
      Dead. His desire to save the world, made him become a Kamikaze, and he decided,
      with a pistol that supports only 5 shots at a time, to attract a group of zombies
      to a small terrain in order to kill everyone ... maybe he didn''t have been
      the best of plans ... (understand why they are called suicidal) let''s see
      how you do! t (^^ t)'
